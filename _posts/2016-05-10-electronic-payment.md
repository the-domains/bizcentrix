# Why Choose TransFirst(r)

TransFirst is a full-service merchant account provider that's working hard to be your \#1 choice for credit card processing. Our approach is simple: We treat all our clients the way we want to be treated --- fairly and professionally.

## Honesty, Integrity and Outstanding Service

We've always operated our business based on the principles of honesty, integrity and outstanding service. Over the years we've provided merchant services to more than 200,000 businesses across all industries.

## Our Clients Speak

TransFirst is always interested in feedback from our clients, especially when the results are as follows:

* 95 percent of merchants award TransFirst a score of 8 or higher when asked, "Based on your experience with TransFirst, would you recommend our company to a friend or colleague?"
* Over 90 percent of merchants award our TransFirst Sales Team an "Exceeds Expectations" rating.
* 95% of merchants rank TransFirst Training and Activations as "Above Average."

Written comments direct from our clients underscore the high level of service and support we provide:

_"Everyone has been very knowledgeable and friendly and always provided a quick response. You don't see this very often, which has been great."_

_"Outstanding start to finish."_

_"Our sales rep was very helpful and offered solutions to lower our monthly fee. The change from our old processor to TransFirst has been painless."_

_"Everything was explained very clear and in a way that I can understand."_

_"The trainer should be rated a 20! He was humble, patient, great! He was a breath of fresh air!"_

_"Everything was a breeze. If there was a question, the trainer always had an answer and explained it in simple terms that anyone could understand."_

At TransFirst, we make it a priority to work directly and personally with each of our clients, always striving to provide the best and most cost-efficient products and services available.

## BBBOnLine Reliability program

As a member of the[BBBOnLine Reliability program][0], we don't believe in selling clients something they don't need; in fact, we're not satisfied until we've identified and fulfilled the unique requirements of each individual member merchant. Other providers make claims, but TransFirst truly delivers experience, products and services you can trust.

## Secure, Low-Cost Processing

Our dedication to our clients is underscored by the strategic alliances we've formed with some of the largest banks and processing networks in the U.S. By aligning with these industry leaders, TransFirst is able to provide bank-direct merchant accounts that save our clients hundreds, if not thousands, of dollars in processing costs each year. In addition to secure, low-cost processing, our merchants' transactions are backed by the strongest, most advanced networks available.

## Cutting-Edge Technology

The ability to accept credit card payments relies heavily on technology, and TransFirst stays on the cutting edge of new developments. We were one of the first merchant services providers to offer Internet merchant accounts, and[our hardware and software options][1]are very tech forward as well. Whatever your processing needs --- traditional point-of-sale retail, Internet, mobile, wireless, or dialup --- our goal is to provide you with the best option to get the job done quickly, securely and at competitive prices.

## Unsurpassed Customer Service

TransFirst[offers customer service and support][2]that's unsurpassed because we know you rely on your credit card processing system day in and day out. Our support personnel are just a toll-free call away, U.S.-based and available 24/7/365\. Should a problem arise, we will work with you until it's resolved to your satisfaction.
